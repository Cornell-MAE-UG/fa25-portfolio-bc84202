As part of a class project, we had to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We had a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from [this online catalog](https://www.tolomatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2700-4000_29_IMA_cat.pdf), use max force values only). Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.
